### About
Hello world!😉 OceanProgrammer is my attempt to teach programming with NOTES. Yes, you read it right. I provide notes of *almost* each video in the description. If you face any problems in downloading notes, check it on github. I too provide source code of every video in github whose link I always provide in description. If you face any problem, feel free to comment or email me(oceanprogrammer@gmail.com).
Happy coding!
